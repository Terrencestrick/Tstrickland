  Hi, my name is Terrence Strickland, I'm a high-functioning Senior Customer Success Manager with over 8 years of experience, I specialize in driving strategic success and growth for a range of clients of all sizes. Whether I am partnering with large enterprise customers looking to test different markets or scale their current products, ultimately becoming the sole focus of my book of business. Or, if I have several customers in my book all at different stages of the customer life cycle.    
  Mastering the ability to take intense ownership of my book coupled with proactive communication allows me to keep a pulse on the health of my partnerships while continuing to look to provide value at all times to my customers. 
  
  At Blueocean, I have shown the flexibility to partner with corporations like the NFL, particularly AMB Sports & Entertainment. Conducting demos, building presentations, and leading conversations with their partners that led to a $25 million deal for AMB Sports after white-labeling our platform and agreeing to a 24-month deal with Blueocean valued at $2.5 million ARR and also allowing our sales team access to their network.
  At Captiv8, I consistently maintained above 85% quarterly renewal rate, bringing in over $2 million in renewed business over the time I spent there. Doing so while averaging around 100 customers ranging from enterprise retail e-commerce customers like ZARA to mid-market customers like Qualtrics. By proactively building relationships, I was consistently able to drive value and data-driven commitments through tailored digital marketing solutions that met my customer's specific needs. 
  I thrive on building long-term, high-touch relationships, optimizing customer engagement, and ensuring the seamless adoption of SaaS platforms to meet and exceed client goals. With a proven track record of working with enterprise customers like GitHub, Dropbox, and Bloomingdale’s, I excel in aligning marketing strategies with business objectives to maximize product utilization and customer retention. 
  
  I bring a deep understanding of email, SMS, and data-driven marketing, combined with a strong ability to collaborate cross-functionally with Sales, Product, and Engineering teams to improve customer outcomes. 
  Known for my analytical mindset, I leverage data insights to identify opportunities, present impactful recommendations, and foster scalable solutions that deliver measurable success. My passion for helping customers become internal champions, coupled with my ability to manage complex accounts and provide strategic value, makes me an asset in any customer-centric role. 
  
  I am excited to continue building meaningful partnerships that drive performance and growth. This an amazing time for me, as I have the opportunity to self-reflect on my skill set and identify opportunities to continue to cultivate my growth mindset.

         This project was a dream for the Blueocean team for quite a while. We wanted to stop spending so much time onboarding our customers to have the flexibility to look at our accounts from a more strategic perspective.
         I decided to take a look at our entire onboarding and implementation process, I began working with my leadership team to analyze where we could start to trim some of the fat. Going through this process I was able to isolate our team's analytics in Gong, I saw a multitude 
         of our customers needing extra onboarding calls due to there being so many teams whose schedules didn't permit all the required stakeholders on the call. 
         
         Ultimately, we were duplicating hour-long calls just to get our customers through onboarding and making sure every question gets an answer. Plus, we still wanted to free up some time during the day for the CS team to allow us to focus on more impactful work. So I volunteered
         to put together a platform orientation video that would act as a generic catch-all for our customers and this video would sent out with the CS welcome email after the customer is handed over from sales. The results were amazing! We saw our customer base show increased adoption across
         the board. The "pre-orientation" video gave our customers a greater understanding of Brand Navigator's functionality and allowed the CS Team more time with our customers to build strategic relationships and success plans tailored to their specific needs. This project was a huge win,
         as we saw a 30% spike in NPS for new customers.

         Here you can find some of my bread-and-butter reports I've built using customer data from Blueocean's Brand Navigator platform. Working in a start-up environment, there are times when your systems or workflows are not the best. 
         Often, you may discover there is a deliverable needed that doesn't exist yet. In my career, I have seized those opportunities to be creative and set myself apart.

          Here are some additional projects I've built to solve team issues with staying organized doing customer marketing campaign launches. In addition to the campaign trackers, I also built templates for EBRs, Strategic alignment calls, and proper customer success plans.
          These templates were massive in helping me assist my team on the renewal calls.

          My broad agency experience advising B2B tech clients was the perfect base for my role as the first customer success hire, allowing me to step into a leadership role and create the Customer Success discipline.

            Presenting at all hands and to our board of directors to highlight customer use cases, revenue growth (ARR/GRR), and renewal data

         Collaborating with my counterparts across GTM, I developed an accurate forecasting process, and capacity planning, aligned our tech stacks, and identified critical customer education needs.
         We implemented ChurnZero to automate and scale our efforts, giving CSMs the ability to focus on the highest priority customer interactions while giving leadership a critical metrics dashboard view of customer retention and growth.

    content: | # This will include new lines to allow paragraphs
      Beyond my professional endeavors, I enjoyed spending quality time with my two daughters (until I met my Wife). Now very soon, I will have 3 daughters and a Wife which of course I am looking forward to being ganged up on my 4 Women in the house.  
      Truly, I wouldn't have it any other way though. My family has instilled in me a profound sense of responsibility and time management. My background as a three-sport athlete (football, basketball, and track) has taught me the value of teamwork, perseverance, and strategic thinking—qualities I enjoy applying in a business context as well. 
      I have to say, I am proud of the man I've become. In my leisure time, I enjoy chess, coaching 8-10-year-old boys football in my community, spending time with my girls, and going to their track meets. We try to find 4 player Co-op video games every chance we get, we're all gamers at heart.
      I've also recently embarked on a journey to learn how to play the guitar. (The kids are brutally honest)
